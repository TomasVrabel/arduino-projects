# AutomatedPump
My Arduino projects

## Improvements
 * Slovak interface
 * fix: next pump should consider also dates, not only hours and min to handle day change at 12pm
 * decrease pump threshold to 1, make configurable
 * make configurable by BT
 * daily, previous day
 * total: pumps, measurements, volume
 * store in memory: today, last day, mode
 * remote control APP
 * solder, make more robust, isolate flowmeter cable
 * LOW PRIO: mode: scheduled, schedule 
 * LOW PRIO: don't use Strings, other code and stability optimizations
